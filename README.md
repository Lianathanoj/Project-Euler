# Project-Euler
I completed problems 1-7 from https://projecteuler.net using python. These were for learning purposes only.

# Pong
Refactored Pong to reflect OO programming. Also coded an intermediate-level opponent with scoreboard system.

# Stockscraper
Used Python's beautifulsoup4 library to scrape stock data from NASDAQ. Runs on command line and prints out a dictionary containing companies' data.

# ALC
Small problem set solved using Python to take advantage of Python's string indexing. Still need to write unit tests for them though.
